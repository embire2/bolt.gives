# bolt.gives v1.0.0 - superior point plan

last updated: 2026-02-12

## goal
Ship a stable, production-ready `v1.0.0` where core collaboration + agent workflows are reliable, observable, secure, and documented.

## done now (integrated + tested)
- [x] build health gate passes
  - `pnpm run typecheck`
  - `pnpm run lint`
  - `pnpm test` (90 passing, 3 skipped)
- [x] openai provider live smoke test passes with `.env.local`
  - model: `gpt-4.1-mini`
  - prompt reply: `smoke-ok`

## release checklist (mark complete only after integration + test evidence)

### 1) real-time collaboration hardening
- [x] multi-client same-file sync test (2+ browsers, same file, no lost edits)
- [x] persistence/reload test (restart collab server, verify doc restore from disk)
- [x] inactivity cleanup test (idle doc eviction without active doc loss)

### 2) interactive step runner hardening
- [x] websocket event stream test (`step-start`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `step-end`, `complete`)
- [x] stop-on-error behavior test (non-zero command aborts remaining steps)
- [x] ui timeline test (events shown in chat in correct order)

### 3) session manager reliability (supabase)
- [ ] save/list/load session test with real supabase table (`tests/api.system.sessions.spec.ts` runs once `public.bolt_sessions` exists; see `docs/supabase/bolt_sessions.sql`)
- [ ] share-link test (`?shareSession=` restores expected chat state) (depends on real supabase config + table)
- [ ] migration/backward compatibility test for missing/partial payload fields (depends on real supabase config + table)

### 4) plan/act checkpoint workflow
- [x] plan generation quality test (clear, actionable numbered steps)
- [x] act mode checkpoint test (confirm, stop, revert all verified)
- [x] diff visibility test at each checkpoint

### 5) test + security automation quality
- [ ] eslint + vuln scan execution test from ui button
- [ ] jest stub generation quality test for newly added functions
- [ ] failure reporting test (clear suggested fixes in ui)

### 6) multi-modal prompt flow
- [ ] voice-to-text prompt insertion test (mic start/stop + transcript accuracy)
- [ ] sketch json export test (rect + text structures valid)
- [ ] prompt merge test (text + sketch payload both reach model input)

### 7) model orchestrator confidence
- [x] low/medium/high complexity routing tests with deterministic fixtures
- [x] manual override precedence test from settings
- [x] selection logging + chat transparency test

### 8) performance monitor accuracy
- [x] cpu/memory sampling sanity test vs process metrics
- [x] token accounting test across multiple responses
- [x] threshold recommendation test (warnings trigger at configured limits)

### 9) deployment wizard safety
- [x] generated workflow yaml validation test (netlify/vercel/github-pages)
- [ ] deploy trigger test from ui
- [ ] rollback api test with provider sandbox tokens

### 10) plugin marketplace safety
- [x] manifest schema validation test (reject invalid plugin manifests)
- [x] install/uninstall runtime load test
- [x] marketplace fetch failure handling test (network + malformed json)

### 11) release docs and packaging
- [ ] finalize `README.md` and install flow against fresh machine checklist
- [ ] verify product naming consistency (`bolt.gives v1.0.0`) across ui/scripts/meta
- [ ] prepare changelog + one-feature-per-pr backport plan for upstream

## step-by-step dev plan
1. lock release baseline by keeping typecheck/lint/test green on every change.
2. run high-risk flow e2e first: collaboration, step runner, plan/act, sessions.
3. run provider-backed smoke checks (openai + at least one secondary provider).
4. harden security/test automation and verify clear failure reporting in ui.
5. validate performance monitor metrics and threshold recommendations.
6. validate deployment wizard + rollback in provider sandboxes.
7. validate plugin marketplace install/uninstall + manifest safety.
8. close docs/release notes, then freeze for final regression pass.

## verification added in this sprint
- `scripts/collaboration-server.spec.ts`: sync, persistence across restart, inactive cleanup.
- `app/lib/runtime/interactive-step-runner.spec.ts`: websocket streaming + stop-on-error.
- `app/lib/runtime/agent-workflow.spec.ts`: plan parsing + act-mode stop/revert checkpoint flow.
- `app/lib/runtime/agent-file-diffs.spec.ts`: per-step file delta + checkpoint diff formatting.
- `app/lib/runtime/model-orchestrator.spec.ts`: low/medium/high routing + manual override.
- `app/lib/services/deploymentWizard.spec.ts`: generated workflow validation + rollback endpoints.
- `app/lib/services/pluginManager.spec.ts`: manifest validation, runtime load, malformed marketplace handling.
- `app/lib/services/session-payload.spec.ts`: session payload normalization/backward-compat.
- `app/components/chat/StepRunnerFeed.spec.tsx`: chat step timeline ordering + clear behavior.
- `app/lib/stores/performance.spec.ts`: token usage accumulation across responses.
- `tests/api.system.performance.spec.ts`: node cpu/memory sampling endpoint behavior.
- `app/components/workbench/PerformanceMonitor.spec.tsx`: threshold warning recommendation rendering.
