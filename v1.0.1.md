# bolt.gives v1.0.1 - execution checklist

last updated: 2026-02-13

## high priority
- [ ] attach images to prompts (verify end-to-end on at least one vision-capable model)
- [x] prevent bolt from rewriting files as often (file locking enforcement + no-op writes)
  - evidence: `app/lib/stores/files.locking.spec.ts`
- [ ] better prompting for smaller llms (ensure code window reliably starts and actions are emitted)
- [ ] run agents in the backend (not just a single model call)

## ux / product
- [ ] mobile friendly
- [ ] better prompt enhancing
- [ ] have llm plan the project in an md file (transparency)
- [ ] vscode integration with git-like confirmations
- [ ] upload documents for knowledge (templates/style guides/reference repos)
- [x] voice prompting (present + tested in v1.0.0)

## providers
- [ ] together integration (confirm api wiring + model list + smoke test)
- [ ] azure openai api integration
- [ ] perplexity integration
- [ ] vertex ai integration

## deployment
- [ ] deploy directly to vercel/netlify/etc (wizard + auth + smoke test)
