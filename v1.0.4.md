# v1.0.4 Roadmap: Private Collaboration Without Losing OSS Freedom

Date: 2026-02-21
Status: Planned

## Release Goal

Take bolt.gives to the next level with private client-hosted instances and team collaboration, while preserving the core promise:

- bolt.gives remains open source and free to download/use.
- bolt.gives core must run without mandatory database setup.
- External databases are optional for user projects, not a requirement for bolt.gives itself.

## Non-Negotiable Product Rules

- [ ] Open-source-first: all core runtime features remain in OSS.
- [ ] Free local/self-host setup remains available without paid lock-in.
- [ ] Zero-required-infra install path: bolt.gives must boot and run with no Supabase/Postgres/MySQL requirement.
- [ ] Optional integrations are opt-in and degrade gracefully when missing.
- [ ] No hidden behavior: actions, reasons, and outcomes stay visible to users.

## Scope Overview

This release focuses on:

1. Private client-hosted instances with strong isolation.
2. Optional Teams add-on collaboration capabilities.
3. Higher reliability and less user friction in scaffold/build flows.
4. Better operator controls, update safety, and auditability.

## P0 (Must Ship)

### P0.1 Zero-Infra Core Runtime Guarantee

- [ ] Ensure core app startup succeeds with only filesystem persistence.
- [ ] Keep Supabase/session cloud paths optional and disabled by default.
- [ ] Add explicit "optional dependency" checks with non-blocking warnings.
- [ ] Add regression tests for no-env startup and no-db run mode.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Fresh Ubuntu 18.04+ install runs with no database config.
- [ ] `chat -> scaffold -> run -> preview` works in zero-db mode.
- [ ] Missing optional env keys never crash app startup.

### P0.2 Client-Hosted Instance Kit (Isolated Deployments)

- [ ] Deliver repeatable bootstrap for isolated customer instances.
- [ ] Add per-instance config and secrets isolation (no cross-instance bleed).
- [ ] Add per-instance workspace root and data directories.
- [ ] Document DNS + SSL + health checks + rollback procedures.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] New instance can be provisioned from docs/scripts in under 30 minutes.
- [ ] Instance A data/config cannot be read from Instance B runtime.
- [ ] Upgrade/rollback path documented and tested.

### P0.3 Teams Add-on (Optional, Feature-Flagged)

- [ ] Add optional team mode behind `BOLT_TEAMS_ENABLED`.
- [ ] Implement workspace roles: Owner, Admin, Editor, Viewer.
- [ ] Add invites and membership management.
- [ ] Add project-level permissions for edits, terminal, deploy, settings.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Single-user mode remains default and unchanged.
- [ ] Team permissions are enforced server-side for all actions.
- [ ] Unauthorized action attempts are blocked and logged.

### P0.4 Collaboration Safety + Audit Trail

- [ ] Add append-only audit events for sensitive actions: model/provider switch, key updates, file writes, shell commands, deploys.
- [ ] Surface audit timeline in UI for operators.
- [ ] Support export of run/audit logs for incident review.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Every critical action contains actor, timestamp, action, outcome.
- [ ] Failed actions are auditable with error context.
- [ ] Audit export works without external database dependency.

### P0.5 Architect v2 (Self-Heal + Guardrail Brain)

- [ ] Expand failure signature library with higher-coverage scaffold/build issues.
- [ ] Add proactive preflight checks before running install/build commands.
- [ ] Enforce safe auto-fix boundaries based on autonomy mode.
- [ ] Add confidence scoring and fallback escalation when auto-fix fails.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Common scaffold/runtime failures auto-heal without user intervention.
- [ ] Architect never reports success without confirmed successful exits.
- [ ] Recovery actions are visible in timeline with plain-English summaries.

### P0.6 Commentary v2 (Plain English, Live, Useful)

- [ ] Keep 60-second max gap for meaningful progress commentary.
- [ ] Reduce jargon by default; move technical detail behind expandable sections.
- [ ] Standardize progress cards: `What I am doing`, `What changed`, `What is next`.
- [ ] Add regression tests for commentary contract adherence.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Users always see understandable progress while code is running.
- [ ] Commentary appears early and continues until completion/failure.
- [ ] Technical detail remains available but does not overwhelm default view.

### P0.7 First-Party Template Packs

- [ ] Add maintained starter templates for high-usage targets: Node API, Vite React, Next.js, static site, Python API.
- [ ] Ensure each template includes run/build scripts and health checks.
- [ ] Add template smoke tests in CI.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Template create/run success rate >= 90% on supported paths.
- [ ] Template metadata clearly declares prerequisites.
- [ ] Users can scaffold without falling into manual recovery loops.

### P0.8 Performance and Long-Run Stability

- [ ] Continue server-first offloading of heavy operations.
- [ ] Cap/trim long timeline payloads with virtualization defaults.
- [ ] Add memory and stall telemetry with operator-friendly thresholds.
- [ ] Prevent degraded responsiveness in longer sessions.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] No major UI freeze in extended coding sessions.
- [ ] Memory growth remains bounded under repeated scaffold/build loops.
- [ ] Performance telemetry visible and actionable.

### P0.9 Cost and Usage Integrity

- [ ] Finalize non-zero cost estimation behavior for all supported providers.
- [ ] Add explicit states for unknown/estimated/incomplete usage.
- [ ] Add provider-specific regression tests for usage mapping.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] `$0` is only shown when usage is genuinely zero.
- [ ] When usage exists, estimate is non-zero and internally consistent.
- [ ] Missing usage fields are surfaced as unknown, not false zero.

### P0.10 Safe Updates Across Instances

- [ ] Add update channel controls (stable/alpha) per instance.
- [ ] Keep one-click update with robust retry/rollback logging.
- [ ] Ensure multi-instance environments can be updated independently.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Operators can update one instance without impacting others.
- [ ] Failed updates auto-surface rollback guidance.
- [ ] Post-update health checks run automatically.

## P1 (Should Ship If Stable)

### P1.1 Lightweight Policy Engine

- [ ] Per-instance policy profiles for shell/network/deploy guardrails.
- [ ] Policy presets for solo dev, team dev, and locked-down enterprise.

### P1.2 Workspace Backup + Restore

- [ ] Snapshot and restore workflows for workspace state.
- [ ] Scheduled local backups with retention controls.

### P1.3 Ops Dashboard

- [ ] Instance-level health view: uptime, errors, recovery rates, update state.
- [ ] Alert-ready logs and diagnostics bundle generation.

### P1.4 Plugin/Connector Stability Contracts

- [ ] Harden connector lifecycle and fallback behavior.
- [ ] Prevent non-critical connector failures from polluting core UX.

## P2 (Stretch / Post-Release Seed)

- [ ] Organization-level fleet management for many isolated instances.
- [ ] SSO/SAML provider integration pack for enterprise teams.
- [ ] Multi-region deployment patterns and disaster-recovery runbooks.
- [ ] Shared template marketplace with signed templates.
